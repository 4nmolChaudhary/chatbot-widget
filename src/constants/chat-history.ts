## Overview
This is a static mockup answer to your question with full markdown support.

## Key Features
- **Streaming Response**: The text flows in real-time for a smooth experience
- **Markdown Support**: Includes headings, bold text, lists, and code blocks
- **Character-by-Character**: Each word appears progressively as it streams

## Code Example
\`\`\`javascript
function streamingResponse() {
  console.log("This is a code block in markdown");
  return "Streaming content";
}
\`\`\`

## How It Works
In a real application, this would be replaced with actual AI-generated content. The streaming effect demonstrates how responses flow in real-time, creating a smooth and engaging user experience.

> **Note**: You can customize this response text to match your needs, and it will stream down character by character just like a real AI response would.`,
